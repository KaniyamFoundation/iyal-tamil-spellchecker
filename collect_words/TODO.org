write a python code to do below things.

- A folder has many subfolders and text files. collect the words and their frequency in a file called "tamil_words.txt"
- when the folder is updated with new files, updated the tamil_words.txt file with only the changes.
- have a cache file recording the incoming filename and hash, so that avoid parsing that file next time.
- sort the dictionary file with desending order 
- show counter, progress, time
 - add one more file "most_used_tamil_words.txt" with the same content of frequent_tamil_words.txt but with only words.
